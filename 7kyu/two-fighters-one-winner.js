// Both health and damagePerAttack (damage_per_attack for python) will be integers larger than 0. You can mutate the Fighter objects.

// Your function also receives a third argument, a string, with the name of the fighter that attacks first.

// Example:
//   declare_winner(Fighter("Lew", 10, 2), Fighter("Harry", 5, 4), "Lew") => "Lew"

//   Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 3 health.
//   Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 6 health.
//   Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 1 health.
//   Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 2 health.
//   Lew attacks Harry: Harry now has -1 health and is dead. Lew wins.
